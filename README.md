# screenDim - smart screen dimming for multi-monitor setups
ScreenDim automatically dims inactive displays in multi-monitor environments: 
- helping you save energy,
- reduce eye strain,
- and extend screen lifespan (especially for OLED technology),
- all without breaking your window layout.

When working on multiple screens, you often focus on just one for long periods ‚Äî reading, coding, or designing ‚Äî while the others stay on, wasting power and distracting your eyes.
Turning those displays off completely isn‚Äôt ideal either: Windows repositions your open windows and icons when a monitor disconnects.

screenDim solves this by detecting inactivity on each display and smoothly dimming unused screens instead of turning them off. Once you move your mouse back to a dimmed screen, it brightens instantly and returns to normal.

# HOW TO RUN:
1) pip install monitorcontrol pyqt5 pyautogui wmi
2) python screenDimmer.py

# HOW IT WORKS:
1) A tray icon appeears
2) Single-click on icon to toggle active/inactive
3) Double-click to exit the program
4) Right-click to display the settings (saved to a .json file)
5) If active, program checks mouse activity on every disaply
6) If no mouse activity, then display is slowly being turned off (brightness -> low & pixels -> black)
7) On mouse movement, the display goes back to original state
8) Idea is to avoid switching off displays completely so the operating system does not mess up the windows arrangement

# TODOs:
- Potential issue: May firstly check if "readLuminance" worked (try), and only if worked assign level_default !
- May use some power-saving mode for modern display (still keeping display detected by the operating system)
- May apply semi-transparent background for older displays to achive gradient dimming
- Full testing and adaptation to different OS (was written on Windows)
- Apply the dim-layer to all virtual desktops (not only the current one)
- Do not display the dim-layer window as a program in the bottom bar; do not disturb user when applying the dim-layer
